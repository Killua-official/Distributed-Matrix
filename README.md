# Task 4: Distributed Matrix Operation Computaton

**Topics:** 
- Parallelism
- Sockets
- REST API

**Description:**
A distributed application for computing the product of two
large matrices. Matrix parts are processed in parallel across different nodes, and
results are transmitted to a central server. Metadata (computation time,
nodes, resource usage) must are sent via REST API.

**Architecture:**
Include a diagram showing data distribution across nodes and
result transmission.

**Stack:**
- Java
- Kafka
- Docker
- Prometheus
- Graphana
